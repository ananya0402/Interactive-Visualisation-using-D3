# Interactive Visualisation using D3

The visualisation presents network data and provides tooltips when the user hovers the mouse pointer above the visual elements.
Detail of the task:

* Read in the data using D3.
* Draw the locations as circles, and make the radius of circles proportional to the total trading amount at that location.
* Draw the trading as lines between the locations, and make the thickness of lines proportional to the amount.
* Provide these following interactions:
* Hovering on a circle, highlight the circle and all lines connected to it (by making other circles and lines transparent).
* Hovering on a circle, show a tooltip with its information about the total amount of trading  at that location and the number of connected locations.
* Circles should be rendered on top of lines.
